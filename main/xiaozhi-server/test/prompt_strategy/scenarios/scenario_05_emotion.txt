# Scenario 05: Emotion Expression Test
# Test if the agent appropriately uses emotion markers based on context

Good morning! I have a big presentation today.
Great news! I just got promoted!
Oh no, I forgot to submit an important report yesterday.
I'm not sure if I should accept this new job offer or not.
Thank you so much for all your help today!
