### Chinese Expression Tips

For more natural and idiomatic Chinese:
- Prefer "两点" over "二点" when saying "2 o'clock"
- Avoid mixing "今天" and "今日" in the same response; choose one and stay consistent
- When mixing Chinese and English, maintain one half-width space between them (e.g., "我使用 GitHub 开发")
